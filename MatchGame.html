  Reflection:
	    Something that went well is when I was coding JavaScript because 
    it is pretty similar to Java. Additionally, trying to create the style 
    of the game is relatively easy. However, something that didn’t go as 
    intended is when I was trying to use some of the functions in JavaScript 
    because I have never used them before and it is kind of difficult to 
    understand how they worked. Not only that but placing the cards and 
    trying to turn them over was also difficult. There were many things that 
    I have learned from researching about functions to use in order to code 
    this matching game. Two of them were the “addEventListener” and the 
    “setTimeout.” The “addEventListener” sets up a function to any object, 
    while the “setTimeout” sets a timer that executes a function or specified 
    piece of code once the timer expires.

                The game mechanics are simple. Click on an image to reveal it. 
                It will stay revealed until you click on a second image. 
                If both images match, they will stay revealed. If they don’t, 
                they will both change back into the hidden icon. 
                Once all of the images have been revealed the game ends. 
                The score is determined by the number of clicks. 
                Each time you click on one of the images, you score
                will increment by 1, where the lowest possible score is 16 if you 
                already know where all of the images are or you are insanely lucky). 
                When the reset button is clicked, all of the images will return 
                to the hidden icon and the score will be reset to 0.
